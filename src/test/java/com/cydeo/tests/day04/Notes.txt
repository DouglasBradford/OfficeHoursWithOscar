What is Page Object Model Design Pattern?
create a Java Class for each page of your application

How do we implement POM Design?
have a constructor
    - initialize driver instance
    - object of that specific class
    - PageFactory.initElements(driver,this)
*  after this step instead of using findElement/s methods we use @FindBy annotations

What are the advantages? PIQ: What are the attributes of a good automation framework?
    - re-usability

Singleton Driver Design Concept?
one object means : one single opened browser which uses same driver throughout different classes

       What do we need?
       - Special Driver Utility Class
            - encapsulated driver object (you can NOT create object directly)
            - call getDriver method to create object
            - we need browser type, either hard coded or called from .properties file

In your test framework:
    Maybe- you will have an abstract Parent class POM

    Real Life Scenario on what to automate and what not to?
