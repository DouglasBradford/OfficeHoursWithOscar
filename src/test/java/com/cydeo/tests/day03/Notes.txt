    Real life UI test scenario
    1. You will get one Test ticket for a feature
    2. Manually Test it to see and create test steps
    3. If you think that these tests should be automated then you start coding
    4. You run your tests locally (at your personal PC)
    5. You push and create PR (pull request) and your code merges to general company framework
    6. Your tests run daily (even sometimes every 2 hours) in a remote machine

   You will NOT see actually browsers opening or closing
